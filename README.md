# PySide6 100-Day Tutorial Project

Welcome to the **PySide6 100-Day Tutorial Project**! This project is designed to be a comprehensive journey through the PySide6 framework, where each day brings new lessons, challenges, and code examples that build on each other. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your knowledge of PySide6, this series covers everything you need to know.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a day-by-day exploration of the PySide6 framework. Each day focuses on different modules, classes, or functions within PySide6, providing in-depth code examples and practical applications. The goal is to cover the entire PySide6 API, offering a hands-on approach to learning by doing.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each day targets specific PySide6 components, with detailed explanations and examples.
- **Sequential Learning**: The tutorials are designed to build upon previous lessons, ensuring a gradual progression from basic to advanced topics.
- **Real-World Applications**: Code examples are designed to solve real-world problems, providing practical skills you can apply to your own projects.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: The project is cross-platform, supporting macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or later
- PySide6 library
- A code editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode)
- macOS, Windows, or Linux operating system

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python.git
   cd Python
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Examples

Each day's tutorial is contained within its own folder (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, etc.). To run a specific day's examples:

```bash
cd Day01
python main.py
```

Replace `Day01` with the desired day you wish to explore.
